## Introduction

With our new model *ColPali*, we propose to leverage VLMs to construct efficient multi-vector embeddings in the visual space for document retrieval. By feeding the ViT output patches from PaliGemma-3B to a linear projection, we create a multi-vector representation of documents. We train the model to maximize the similarity between these document embeddings and the query embeddings, following the ColBERT method.

Using ColPali removes the need for potentially complex and brittle layout recognition and OCR pipelines with a single model that can take into account both the textual and visual content (layout, charts, ...) of a document.

This repository contains notebooks for learning about the ColVision family of models, fine-tuning them for your specific use case, creating similarity maps to interpret their predictions, and more! üòç

## Instructions

### Open with Colab

The easiest way to use the notebooks is to open them from the `examples` directory and click on the Colab button below:

![Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open_in_Colab-F9AB00?logo=googlecolab&logoColor=fff&style=for-the-badge)

This will open the notebook in Google Colab, where you can run the code and experiment with the models.

### Run locally

If you prefer to run the notebooks locally, you can clone the repository and open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or in your IDE.
